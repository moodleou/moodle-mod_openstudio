# Open Studio

Copyright 2020 The Open University

OpenStudio is a course activity that allows students to share images, files and other media; it can be shared within groups, or used as an individual's work portfolio. OpenStudio is a creative, collaborative space for students to work as if they are physically in a design studio, sharing their work with teachers and other students and getting feedback on it, and commenting other people's work.
